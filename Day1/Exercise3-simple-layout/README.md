## 🎯 Practice Exercise 3: Simple Layout

**Task:** Combine multiple components together

**Requirements:**
1. Create three components:
   * `Header.jsx` - with site title "My React App"
   * `Content.jsx` - with a heading and paragraph
   * `Footer.jsx` - with "© 2025 My App"
2. Import all three into `App.jsx` and arrange them vertically

**Sample Output:**
```
My React App
---
Welcome to React
This is my first multi-component app.
---
© 2025 My App
```

**Challenge:** Add a navigation menu to the Header with 3 links
